# Experiment-Tracking-with-MLflow
This repository contains demonstration of performing experiment tracking with MLflow

This project demonstrates experiment tracking in machine learning using MLflow and DagsHub, applied to the classic Wine Quality dataset. The main goal is to showcase how to manage and visualize experiments efficiently — from model parameters to metrics and artifacts — all in one integrated workflow.

Project Overview

Tracking experiments manually can get chaotic fast — especially when you’re tuning multiple models, hyperparameters, or datasets.
This project solves that by integrating MLflow, a lightweight and flexible tool for experiment management, with DagsHub, a platform for version control and collaboration for ML projects.

Here, I’ve:

Trained a Random Forest Classifier on the Wine Quality dataset.

Tracked model parameters, metrics, and artifacts with MLflow.

Synced experiment tracking seamlessly to DagsHub.

Compared multiple runs to analyze model performance and reproducibility.
